# Project Plan

## Title
How does CO2 effects our tempraure?.

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. How does CO2 effects our tempraure?

## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
When analyzing the correlation between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and global temperatures, the main problem or question being addressed can be framed as follows:

**Problem Statement:**
Understanding the Correlation Between CO2 Emissions and Global Temperatures

**Context:**
Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels, have led to a significant increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations. This rise in CO2 levels is associated with global warming, impacting Earth's climate and leading to concerns about climate change.

**Main Problem:**
Determine the Correlation Between CO2 Emissions and Global Temperatures

**Importance:**
This problem is crucial because it addresses the fundamental question of whether the increase in CO2 emissions is correlated with rising global temperatures. If a strong positive correlation exists, it strengthens the argument that human activities are contributing to climate change. Understanding this correlation is essential for developing effective strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change and inform policies aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

**Project Overview:**
This project analyzes the correlation between CO2 emissions and global temperatures using Method A. By applying statistical methods to historical datasets, the goal is to quantify the relationship between these two variables and assess the significance of the correlation.

**Expected Insights:**
The results of this analysis can provide insights into the following areas:
- The strength and direction of the correlation between CO2 emissions and global temperatures.
- Whether changes in CO2 levels precede or follow changes in temperature.
- The potential implications for climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.

**Overall Significance:**
Understanding the correlation between CO2 emissions and global temperatures is crucial for guiding climate policies, informing sustainable practices, and fostering global efforts to address the challenges posed by climate change. The project aims to contribute valuable insights that can guide decision-makers in developing effective strategies to mitigate the impact of human activities on the Earth's climate.

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->

For now i am planning to use 2 datasets Datasource1 "Global-CO2-Emissions" and Datasource2 "GLobal-Temprature" 

### Datasource1: Global-CO2-Emissions
<!-- Added matatdeta link for Co2 -->
* Metadata URL: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mabdullahsajid/tracking-global-co2-emissions-1990-2023/
* Data URL: url.csv?
* Data Type: CSV

### Datasource2: GLobal-Temprature
<!-- Added matatdeta link for Co2 -->
* Metadata URL: https://data.world/data-society/global-climate-change-data
* Data URL: https://query.data.world/s/43ofhgffvrdjkfx577ih5j6prp4rdr?dws=00000
* Data Type: CSV

## Work Packages

<!-- List of work packages ordered sequentially, each pointing to an issue with more details. -->

1. Find a dataset encompassing global carbon dioxide emissions and temperature records compiled by all countries. [#1][i1]
2. Perform data cleaning to address instances where no data is present. [#2][i2]
3. Finding common Years in both datasets by countries. [#3][i3]
